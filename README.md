# DragDownforcePractice
In this repository, I will study the usage of snappyHexMesh for meshing race cars. Then, using simpleFoam, I will create an example case to study the drag and downforce generated by a given car design. Lastly, I will analyze how drag and downforce vary when a car is following another car.
